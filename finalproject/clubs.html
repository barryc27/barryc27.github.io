				<h2>Clubs:</h2>

        <p><h4>MockTrial: </h4></p>
      <p> I have participated in Mock Trial for two years now.  To be a member of Mock Trial you have to audition.  The auditions are very selective and competitive.  Last year I was a juror and this year I was a witness.  I had an extremely fun time being a witness.  My responsibilities include long meetings after school multiple times a week, memorizing my testimony and practice practice practice!  Because of our hard work, this year and past we made it to the County Finals.  This was extremely exciting and stressful.  I look forward to participating in Mock Trial again next year, and hopefully this time as a lawyer!</p>
      <p> <h4> Science League: </h4> <p>
      <p> Science League is a club where the members take around 4 tests a year after school on the current science they are taking in school.  Last year I took the Biology tests as I took Honors Biology as a freshman and this year I took the Chemistry tests because I was in Honors Chemistry.  To become a member you have to take a qualifying test and be in the top 4 for your subject.  Science League was certainly a lot of fun and I look forward to participating in it again next year!</p>
