				<h3>About Me:</h3>

				<p>My name is Caroline Barry.  I'm 15 years old and am a rising Junior at Chatham High School.  I consider myself to be a math and science oriented person.  This can be seen as I love to problem solve and learn new things, as well as the fact that I  am a member of Science League.  I always love a good challenge and am an extremely hard worker which is why I joined Mock Trial.  For the past two years in a row we were County Finalists.  I also consider myself to be extremely passionate and loving.  This can be seen through my time doing volunteer work. A couple of the hobbies are lacrosse and squash.  Lastly, something you may not know about me is that I am a competitive violinist.  Welcome to my website and I hope you enjoy!</p>
