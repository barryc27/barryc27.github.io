      <p> I have been playing the violin for around ten years now.  I am a member of the Chamber Orchestra at my high school.  This is a selective, audition only Orchestra.  This past winter concert I had was lucky enough to play a solo that I had to audition for.  I am also a competitive violinist.  I have participated in the Golden Key Music Festival as well as the Crescendo International Music Competition.  I have won silver and bronze.  Because of this I have played solos at Carnegie Hall and Jazz at Lincoln Center.  Preparing for these competitions is a huge time commitment as well as a lot of hard work, but it is definitely all worth it! </p>
      <p> <h4> Sports: </h4> <p>

      <p>  I have been very involved in sports throughout my entire life.  I played travel lacrosse with Building Blocks Lacrosse for around 4 years.  This was an extreme commitment.  It took up every weekend during the summer.  We had countless tournaments some of which were as far away as Virginia, which can be an eleven hour long car ride.  I no longer play with this team, but I learned great values such as teamwork with them.  I still play with my high school team as a defender and was on JV this past year.  Another sport I play is Squash.  Unfortantely, my school does not have a team, but I play at my local gym.  I go to tournments during the season and am in the U17 Girls division.  This winter I won second place at a tournment.  Some other physical activities I enjoy are going on scenic walks and bike rides.</p>
