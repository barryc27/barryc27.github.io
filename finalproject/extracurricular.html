      <p> I have been playing the violin for over ten years.  I am a member of the Chamber Orchestra at my high school.  This is a selective, audition only orchestra.  During last year's winter concert, I was selected to play a solo.  In addition, I won awards at the Golden Key Music Festival, as well as the Crescendo International Music Competition.  This provided me with the amazing opportunity to perform solos at Carnegie Hall and Jazz at Lincoln Center.  Preparing for these competitions was a huge time commitment and entailed a lot of hard work. However, it was definitely all worth it! </p>
      <p> <h4> Sports: </h4> <p>

      <p>  I have been very involved in sports throughout my entire life.  I played travel lacrosse with Building Blocks Lacrosse for 4 years. We played in many tournaments some of which were as far away as Virginia.  I no longer play with this team, but I learned great values from playing travel lacrosse, such as teamwork and sportmanship.  I still play with my high school team as a defender.  I also love to play squash.  Unfortunately, my school does not have a team, but I play at my local gym.  I play in tournaments during the season and am in the U17 Girls division.  I won second place at a tournament.  There are many recreational sports I enjoy including, skiing, tennis, spinning, going on scenic walks and bike rides.</p>
