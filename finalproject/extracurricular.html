      <p> I have been playing the violin for around ten years now.  I am a member of the Chamber Orchestra at my high school.  This is a selective, audition only Orchestra.  This past winter concert I had was lucky enough to play a solo that I had to audition for.  I am also a competitive violinist.  I have participated in the Golden Key Music Festival as well as the Crescendo International Music Competition.  I have won silver and bronze.  Because of this I have played solos at Carnegie Hall and Jazz at Lincoln Center.  Preparing for these competitions is a huge time commitment as well as a lot of hard work, but it is definitely all worth it! </p>
      <p> <h4> Sports: </h4> <p>

      <p> Science League is a club where the members take around 4 tests a year after school on the current science they are taking in school.  Last year I took the Biology tests as I took Honors Biology as a freshman and this year I took the Chemistry tests because I was in Honors Chemistry.  To become a member you have to take a qualifying test and be in the top 4 for your subject.  Science League was certainly a lot of fun and I look forward to participating in it again next year!</p>
